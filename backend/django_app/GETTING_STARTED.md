## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I change a student's track?**
```python
from programs.models import Track, Enrollment
enrollment = Enrollment.objects.get(user_id=1, cohort_id=1)
enrollment.track = Track.objects.get(key='offensive')
enrollment.save()
```

**Q: How do I remove a student from a cohort?**
```python
from enrollment_utils import unenroll_student
unenroll_student(1, 1)
```

**Q: Can I add more students?**
Yes, use the same pattern in `enrollment_utils.py` to create new users and enroll them.

**Q: What if a student is already enrolled?**
The system will skip them and print a warning. They're idempotent.

**Q: Where are students 1-100 distributed?**
- Cohort 1: students 1-50 (10 per track)
- Cohort 2: students 51-100 (10 per track)
