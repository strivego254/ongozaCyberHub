  estimated_duration: "180"
  track: defender
narrative:
  context_location: Core Grid Substation, OCH Cyber-city
  scenario: >-
    An intruder has breached the perimeter of the "Core Grid." Alarms are silent, but unusual SMB traffic has been observed between workstations.
    You must analyze the PCAP files to map the attacker's movement through the network topology and identify the compromised credentials used to pivot.
